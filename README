As we can see in the table above, the addition will always be faster than multiplication.
This is because it is a much "cheaper" application than mult which uses addition over and over.

We also see that the eigen matrix works faster then my mtrix both on add nad on mult.
This is probably because (and I say probably since I dont actually know how eigen is implemented,
so what I'm saying is only a logical guess) my mult works by the naive algorithm which takes
O(n^3) and there are faster algorithms out there which I guess Eigen uses. It is possible that for
add they also use some manipluation which makes it faster.
Furthermore, perhaps in general the data structure of theirs which they use to build a MatrixXd
has faster access (for example) to values, causing add and mult to be faster.
